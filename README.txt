Shortest distance problem using graph theory
--------------------------------------------
Given a number of vertices (indexed from 1 to #vertices) and the distance (edge length) between pairs of vertices, the program outputs the distance from a start vertex to all other vertices. A distance of -1 means there is no edge connecting the two vertices.

-> Prompts the user for number of vertices and number of edges
-> User should then enter #edges vertex pairs and the edge length between them
-> Enter q start vertex index upon prompt
-> Distances from start point to all other vertices as output

This is an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
